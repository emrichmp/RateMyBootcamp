# RateMyBootcamp.com (currently under dev)
Hi my name is Emrich and I went to a code bootcamp. Currently I am looking for work and I want to work on something! So I'm deciding to start working on RateMyBootcamp.com. It's going to be simialr to RateMyProfessor but for coding bootcamps. There are many out there now so I thought it would be a great time to spend a couple weeks generating it. Let's see what we can do!
